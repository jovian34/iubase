        This standings application is a preview using the new tiebreaker
        rules for 2026 with the 2025 standings. The new tiebreaker rules did 
        not change any team order, but they did change the reason that the 
        0.500 teams were seeded the way they were. In the old rules head-to-head was 
        ignored in a 3+ team tie if not every team had played each 
        other. Going 
        forward, if one team in the group has a better or worse record against 
        all other teams in the group, that team will 
        separate out as best or worst.
      </p>
